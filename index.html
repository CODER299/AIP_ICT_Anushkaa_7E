                    The typical Hindu festivals such as Diwali, Holi and Navratri
                 are celebrated here with much zeal. Along with this, the 
                 Garhwali culture has its festivals such as:

                Harela parv, phooldei, basant panchama, khichdi sankrant, ganga Dussehra.
                Harela parv is celebrated in Kumaon as the first day of the monsoon. 
                It is followed by the festival bhitauli, celebrating the seeds sown by 
                Kumaoni women and the harvest time.
                Igaas is another Garhwali festival; it is celebrated a few days after 
                Diwali and is also known as Garhwali Diwali. The history behind igaas 
                is that the men of Garhwali families who worked in the Army could not come off 
                duty on Diwali. So, they would go home a few days after it, and 
                their families would celebrate Diwali all over again to celebrate their
                 safe homecoming.
